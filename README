Everyone has its own skeleton in the closet, mine is C.

I still remember my first year at Uni when they gave me the K&R and told
me to build a software that would count word occurrences and save the result in a
text file... it seemed a mission impossible, so I decided to wait
better times and retake the programming exam another semester. Since then I've never had
the opportunity to redeem myself because the following semester the
university, due to a Microsoft partnership, replaced C with C#... and the rest
is history (I'm still a .NET developer).

After 12 years it's time to learn C, it's time to write some serious stuff!

These are all the examples in the K&R book
